I am actively looking for updates to the Greater Northshore
portion of the map, particularly those involving new bike
infrastructure.

I am aware of work underway in Shoreline, but I'm rarely
too far over there so find it hard to monitor. (I am on the
NE 145th Street mailing list, though.) I'm also aware of work
planned but not yet underway in Kenmore.

I'm particularly _unaware_ of Woodinville and unincorporated
King County projects. If you're in a position to provide updates
on these, I want to know! And thank you!
