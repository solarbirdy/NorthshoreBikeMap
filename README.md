The Greater Northshore Bike Route Connector Map [(direct link)](https://github.com/solarbirdy/NorthshoreBikeMap/blob/main/Greater%20Northshore%20Bike%20Connector%20Map.png)

Connecting the actively maintained Seattle and 2 Line Eastside bike maps by covering
the cities of Shoreline, Lake Forest Park, Kenmore, Bothell, and Woodinville, along with
Juanita, northern Kirkland, north Redmond, some unincorporated King County, and
southwest Snohomish County communities of Edmonds, Lynnwood, Mountlake Terrace, Briar, and Maltby. 

And the MEGAMAP [(direct link)](https://github.com/solarbirdy/NorthshoreBikeMap/blob/main/MEGAMAP%20Combined%20Bike%20Map%20(Greater%20Northshore%2C%20Seattle%2C%202%20Line%20Eastside%2C%20NW%20King%20County).jpg)

Combining Greater Northshore, City of Seattle, 2 Line Eastside, and a small piece of
King County Regional Trails into a poster-sized high-detail MEGAMAP.

**Latest Release 2.0.7 - November 23, 2025**

* WARNING: EastRail Trail South in Renton near the Seahawks Training Centre will be CLOSED from December 1-5 for regravelling.
* CORRECTION: 132nd/134th from NE 24th to NE 60th in Bellevue along Bridal Trails Park is currently INCORRECTLY labelled as having bike lanes. IT DOES NOT. This will be corrected locally (ala Seattle corrections) and I will relay the error to the maintainers of the 2 Line Bike Connector Map. Thanks to [@astruder](https://github.com/astuder) for the correction.
* CORRECTION: NE 40th in Bellevue between 140th and 148th Ave NE is currently INCORRECTLY labelled as having bike lanes. IT DOES NOT. This will be corrected local (ala Seattle corrections) and I will relay the error to the maintainers of the 2 Line Bike Connector Map. Thanks to [@astruder](https://github.com/astuder) for the correction.
* REMOVED: Work on Sammamish River Trail in Woodinville between 175th and 178th is functionally complete, and no more closures are listed.  

Previous releases:

Changes with 2.0.6/a (November 1, 2025):

* WARNING: Sammamish River Trail will be CLOSED intermittently and without warning entering Woodinville from Bothell between November 3rd and 14th, WITHOUT an official detour. This unacceptable situation is why I'm dropping this release even with the NE 124th situation undefined. (See next entry.) The alternate route you want to take is through the chain link fence gap to 178th NE and successor roads past McLendons, 131st Ave NE under the railroad bridge, and either the 175th Ave NE trail access ramps or trail access points in central Wilmont Gateway Park. (Both maps).
* ADDED, with caveats: 124th Ave NE extension of bike lanes to NE 124th St are, according to Kirkland on October 30th, supposed to be finished by October 31st. That has not happened. However, the north end looks finished and the south end is in rage, so I'll be adding the bike lanes to (Both maps).
* WARNING: South leg of Central Kirkland Connector is now going to be 100% closed through at least the end of NOVEMBER for ongoing emergency sewer work. Alert box modified to indicate the new length of 100% closure. (MEGAMAP only)

Changes with 2.0.5 (October 17, 2025):

* ADDED: Two-way bike lane opened on E. Marginal Way S on 9 October 2025 from Edgar Martinez/Atlantic down to Horton St., at which point you cross over at a new bike crossing to the existing ped/bike mixed-use trail which connects to Spokane Street Trail. This creates a no-car-interaction connection. These bike lanes will be extended from Horton directly to Spokane Street in early 2026. (MEGAMAP)
* ADDED/UPGRADED: Bike lanes on northern 100th Ave NE in Juanita upgraded and extended to cover NE 139th St. through NE 145th St. (Both maps)
* UPDATED WARNING: The south leg of the Central Kirkland Connector is BRIEFLY reopening this weekend (October 18 and 19) for a marathon event before CLOSING again until late October for continuing emergency sewer repair work. Once it does re-open, it will be closing again intermittently for additional work. On the maps proper, this is mostly be an alert box change. (MEGAMAP)

Changes with 2.0.4 (October 3, 2025):

* ADDED: SODO to Georgetown connection along 6th Ave S, Alaska, and Airport Way S. This isn't technically done yet but it is open and people are actively riding it, so I'm adding it.
* ADDED: Georgetown to South Park connection along Albro, Ellis, and E. Marginal Way, with existing bike lanes on 16th Ave S. More work is pending, via technically separate projects rolling out in early 2026.
* ADDED: Significant changes to "commonly used" routes in eastern Mountlake Terrace, western Briar, and even a little NE Lake Forest Park as people find ways to the Mountlake Terrace light rail station. Thanks to [@MHowell@kolektiva.social on Mastodon](https://kolektiva.social/@MHowell) for pointing this out, I hadn't noticed the shift yet.
* ADDED: More people on bikes means more "commonly used" routes in Bothell worth having on the map, so multiple such routes have been added.
* REMOVED: Final warning notice on Juanita Drive near Juanita Bay. The housing construction that has been extending into the roadway isn't 100% complete but it's close enough, it should be good.
* REMOVED: The warning notice on the Interbay Trail near Terminal 9. The "bridge over nothing" (or "bridge to nowhere") which two decades ago went over a driveway is finally gone, much like the driveway, just much much later.

Changes with 2.0.3 (September 19, 2025):

* REMOVED: Thomas Street Bridge warning sign, since the bridge re-opened on schedule
* ADDED: 15th Ave to Beacon Ave S protected bike lanes are finally open! This connects the International District all the way down to Jefferson Park and S. Spokane St.

Changes with 2.0.2 (August 24, 2025):

* ADDED: Redmond Central Connector extension up to Eastrail at NE 124th is open earlier than expected!
* ADDED: Warning flag: the Pier 91 section of Elliot Bay Trail will close from 2 September to 2 October for repaving and rebuilding, including getting replacing that weird steep over-rail bridge. There WILL be a posted detour, but it's kinda long and involves Magnolia Bridge, so I'm flagging it.
* ADDED: A block-long half-dirt connector between Ashworth and Densmore continuing N 157th for pedestrians and bicyclists willing to deal with a dirt path
* ADDED: Extension of a Shoreline Trail Along the Rail fragment south of NE 185th all the way down to NE 180th; at previous check, it didn't quite connect, and now it does
* CORRECTION: 10th Ave NE from 155th to 185th was listed as UNMARKED BUT POPULAR, but has sharrow markings, so will be re-marked as SHARROWS

Changes with 2.0.1 (August 4, 2025):

* ADDED: Alaskan Way Connector linking Elliot Bay Trail to Waterfront Trail with fully separated bikeways. Decades in the making, finally here (MEGAMAP only)
* ADDED: Painted bike lanes on Meridian Ave N in Shoreline between 155th and 175th streets (both maps)
* ADDED: "Commonly used" markers on Meridian Ave N throughout Shoreline (both maps) - this is somewhat aspirational, as there has been use of this road as a secondary to tertiary bike arterial but not quite enough to justify marking it as such until now. I am fairly certain that the new bike lanes in the middle of the route will increase its utility enough to justify it (both maps)
* ADDED: "Commonly used" makers on a section of Fremont Ave in Shoreline, because that section is used a little more than parts of Meridian which now carry that marking, and one should be consistent (both maps)
* ADDED: A weird little section of bike path I found in Lynnwood north of 196th at Wilcox Park. As 196th loses its sidewalks in that area, even this standalone oddness serves a useful purpose if you're sidewalk-biking on 196th (MEGAMAP only)
* ADDED: A few more street names in City of Seattle, along with a couple of small adjustments on difficult streets (both maps)
* CORRECTION: REI Lynnwood's icon was placed very slightly left of its actual location, and has been adjusted (MEGAMAP only)

Changes with 2.0.0 (July 15, 2025):

The big update this release is making City of Seattle street labels legible when printed. This was a pretty large and time consuming project for several reasons, and involved patching many parts of the map by hand. This project is one of the reasons there are many small corrections in City of Seattle this release.

* ADDED: The abovementioned font embiggening. I only enlarged street names which are directly or indirectly related to bike routes. I also added some street names left out in the original. If you would find other absent or small street names useful, please let me know and I will add and/or enlarge those, too (Seattle)
* ADDED: Bell Street improved bike facilities (Seattle) 
* ADDED WARNING: Construction underway for new bike lanes and sidewalk improvements on 61st Ave/Place (Kenmore)
* RECONSTRUCTED: The north side of University Bridge in the U. District is a mess in real life, and I was asked to rework their map to at least try and make it more comprehensible. I tried. Feedback WILL be considered (Seattle)
* WARNING: **The East Thomas to Elliott Bay Trail bridge** over the railroad tracks is **closing for construction THROUGH AUGUST**. Estimate for re-opening is September 3rd (Seattle)
* WARNING: **Cross-Kirkland Connector trail will be CLOSED** due to construction at 85th Street until **May of 2026**. There will be signed detours (both ADA and not), but they're out of your way (Kirkland)
* CORRECTION: A major maps error in Lake City still present in Seattle 2025 has finally been corrected here. This involved one bike route off a cliff and another down a multistorey stairwell. You're welcome. (Seattle)
* Several other small Seattle 2023/2025 errors corrected - mislabelled streets, things like that (Seattle)

Between the font enlargement and both 2 Line Connector Eastside and City of Seattle dropping 2025 updates, I am bumping the major version of Maps to 2. Really, I should've done it already, but at this point it's pretty comprehensive so I think we deserve a 2.0. As a treat. Enjoy. 

Changes with 1.8.0 (June 8, 2025):

Seattle have dropped a new bike map for 2025 and 2026, but have chosen to show several incomplete and/or entirely unstarted projects as completed. We respectfully disagree with this decision, as it will direct map users to infrastructure which is not actually present.

Therefore, we have chosen to stay with Seattle 2023 as our Seattle-area base map. We will take on the additional work of updating it for the next year, as we have been doing already. In addition to not showing incomplete/nonexistent infrastructure, this means we will continue to group "Neighbourhood Greenway" and "Healthy Street" under the same common green colour - Seattle 2025 breaks them out into blues and greens.

As additional Seattle projects are completed, we will add them to our maps. Once all projects shown on Seattle 2025 are completed, we will most likely transition to Seattle 2025 as our Seattle base map.

Updates to our maps for this release include:

* Juanita Drive bike lanes are finally open (again) in Juanita! There's still a little construction on sidewalks, but functionally, they're done
* 1st Ave NW neighbourhood greenway north of Greenwood to Broadview added
* S. Walden/Della neighbourhood greenway added
* Ashworth Ave mix of neighbourhood greenway and ped/bike shared path added
* N. 120th St. neighbourhood greenway from Ashworth Ave to Corliss Ave added
* N. 130th St. bike lanes north of Haller Lake added
* W. Marginal Way SW bike lanes extended north to 17th Ave SW
* 6th Ave NW steepness indicator in Fremont corrected
* 6th Ave NW Neighbourhood Greenway corrected (was marked as bike lane)
* Alki Drive/Beach Drive SW Healthy Street in West Seattle added
* Maple Leaf Reservoir Neighbourhood Greenway added
* Pike Street bike lane hillclimb over I-5 updated to reflect upgraded status
* 21st Ave Greenway/Health Street from Columbia to Yesler added
* Greenway/Healthy Street connection between 30th Ave S east of MLK to Mountains-to-Sound Trail added
* 39th Ave South Greenway/Healthy Street from south of Othello to Kenyon added
* One block of Neighbourhood Greenway on 27th Ave NE north of Lake City REMOVED
* Several small corrections/adjustments, carrying forward Seattle map corrections/adjustments

Changes with 1.7.1 (June 1, 2025) (1.7.0, we hardly knew ye):

* Extension of bike lanes in Kenmore on 80th Ave NE up to NE 185th/186th street
* Refinement of intersections with streets on Interurban Trail North in Snohomish County
* Small additions (short bike lane, shorter trails) around Totem Lake
* Small addition (short mixed-use trail, pedestrian first but bikes permitted) in northern Woodinville at 130th/132nd
* Addition of north bike exit from Shoreline North 1 Line station - possibly part of the Trail Under the Rail system? It's not signed as such but it's in the right place for it.
* Text cleanup in Redmond, replacing/moving text which gets cut off on the Greater Northshore map so that it is no longer cut off.

Changes with 1.7 (May 10, 2025):

* **MAJOR EASTSIDE UPGRADE** with the freshly dropped 2 Line Eastide Bike Connector Map. There are several updates, but the biggest are the two light rail stations opening on 10 May 2025.
* Notes about infrastructure continuance off-map now appear on both Greater Northshore and MEGAMAP, with the indicators relocating themselves as appropriate.
* Same for the two major directional notices to Alderwood Mall and City of Snohomish, both of which are too far north for this map.
* Addition with reservations of a short section of what are technically bike lanes in Woodinville. I don't like them and marked them as undermarked, because they are, in person.
* Construction on NE 132nd has extended bike lanes! And made the crossing of I-405 more confusing and probably slower! But also probably safer. It's a tradeoff, and it's on the maps now.
* NE 116th in Redmond has extended bike lanes now, but without the complexity adds of 132nd.
* LOTS of behind-the-scenes work adapting to the new 2 Line update. The biggest unresolved question: should I change my key to match theirs? They've changed fully-separate bike path to a very dark green instead of red. I have NOT done that on 1.7. Opinions?

Changes with 1.6.1 (May 3, 2025):

* Correction of errors on 84th West in Snohomish County, where sharrows had been incorrectly shown as full bike lanes across a couple of blocks where only one side has full bike lanes
* Added bike lane markers for Forbes Creek Drive in Kirkland
* Further cleanup of the trail situation in and around Crestwoods Park, Kirkland
* Added Old Market Street Trail in Juanita
* Added continuation notes showing how far infrastructure continues on the MEGAMAP's northern border

Changes with 1.6 (April 18, 2025):

* Large expansion north to Lynnwood City Centre rail station across all of SW Snohomish County
* Extension of Interurban Trail in Edmonds to 78th Place West.
* Improved street labelling, mostly in SW Snohomish County.
* Route indicators at map edges describing past-map continuations to destinations such as UW and City of Snohomish

Changes with 1.5.1 (March 8, 2025):

* Additional labels in Lake Forest Park aiding navigation to Mountlake Terrace Light Rail Station
* Final section opening of the Waterfront Bike Trail in Seattle
* Clarified warning signs on mostly- but not quite complete bike lanes on 15th Ave S. in Seattle
* Honey Dew Creek Trail (paved section) and connection routes added in Newcastle/Renton

Changes with 1.5 (February 21, 2025):

* By request, we now cover Newcastle and northernmost Renton, providing the first maps coverage of that area we know about - certainly the most detailed. One benefit of doing so is that we can now provide additional clarity to the southern Lake Washington Loop. (MEGAMAP)
* Added bike lane infrastructure in and around 100th Ave W. in Edmonds (Greater Northshore, MEGAMAP) 
* Upgrade of bike lanes along 15th Avenue S. in Seattle, resulting in a change of marking type (MEGAMAP)

Changes with 1.4.6 (28 January 2025):

* Removal of a bike store icon in Roosevelt and 84th
* Addition of a "Difficult" label on Power Line Trail
* Addition of fully-separated bike lane on 11th Ave NE from 47th to Ravenna, and on 12th Ave NE from Ravenna to NE 69th
* Waterfront Trail: Yesler to Union now open
* Eastlake from Fairview to John now has separated bike lanes, with more to come

Changes with 1.4.5 (13 December 2024):

* The full long-term remapping of Montlake Boulevard at SR-520 with the new bike/pedestrian bridge (opening ceremony **14 December**, was supposed to be finished on the 13th but is not but I'm going with it anyway; MEGAMAP only)
* New Safe/Neighbourhood Greenway streets in northern Lake City (already open; Greater Northshore and MEGAMAP)
* Improved bike lanes/partial off-street lanes in Redmond on 152nd Ave NE north of NE 24th St. (already open; MEGAMAP only)

Changes with 1.4.4 (4 November 2024):

* Yet another correction to Seattle's map showing NW 125th between Interurban and Aurora as sharrows, not bike lanes (thank you, [@pruwyben@social.ridetrans.it](https://social.ridetrans.it/@pruwyben))
* Construction warning flag removed with the end of Burke-Gilman repaving in Bothell
* MEGAMAP only: substantial update/rework of the Montlake Boulevard/SR-520 intersection. Not all planned bike facilities are yet open, but some are.

Changes with 1.4.3:

* Updating Juanita Drive construction area with a temporary downgrade to sharrow, recommending detour
* Slope markers on the closest, most obvious detour route (NE 123rd, NE 132nd)
* NEW BIKE UNDERPASS from Montlake to Bill Dawson trail is open, edited Seattle's map to show
* Additional sharrows in Kirkland near Mark Twain Park
* New 6th Ave NW neighbourhood greenway in Fremont, yes I'm updating Seattle's map for them again
* Updating/clarifications around Montlake Boulevard at SR-520; it's in flux but this is close
* Yes half these changes are on Seattle's map and mostly that's why this version got dropped

Changes with 1.4.2:

* Sammamish River closed one month for construction in Bothell. **There is a detour and it is reasonable**, but I have flagged it on the map as it is a major route.
* Some of the new bike parking icons must be smaller than others, but some were *too* small. These have been enlarged.
* A few small cosmetic improvements

Changes with 1.4.1:

* Updated/added bike locker locations
* Three missing blocks of bike lane and sharow in Lake Forest Park
* Two new blocks of bike lane near Shoreline South station
* Most of the shoulder on Woodinville-Duvall Road is not officially bike lane, turns out one section between 156th and 171st is official, so added
* I-405 in blue, which matched the colour used by 2 Line Bike Connector Map, was too easily confused with water so was changed to an intensity-matched grey
* Other small cosmetic adjustments

Changes with 1.4:

* New data type - Link Light Rail 1 Line stations
* Added several street name labels, particularly around the new 1 Line rail stations, for improved wayfinding
* Cleaned up other street name labels where bike infrastructure overlaid the KCGIS names
* NEW SEATTLE BIKE ROUTE: MLK north from S. Winthrop to two blocks north of I-90. That's right, it's not on their map yet, but it's open and on mine. 
* Upgraded block connection between Bothell Way and NE 181st/Remington in Kenmore to "Sharerow" after improved paint went in
* "Very Bumpy" advisory REMOVED from Shoreline Interurban Trailhead due to repaving, thank you wildjo here on Github
* Re-added trail exit from Shoreline Interurban Trailhead that got lost somehow in a previous map revision (very small)
* Added two more short sections of what will be the "Trail By the Rail" in Shoreline, adjusted exact ending point of the largest section already on the map, thank you https://social.ridetrans.it/@bobco85 on Mastodon

Changes with 1.3.2:

* Extension of bike lanes on NE 170th in Kenmore to Juanita Boulevard (new construction)
* Addition of new bike shop icon (Eastside Ski & Sport) along East Rail Trail
* Bike parking icon placement and other minor adjustments

Changes with 1.3.1:

* Typo fixed in street number in Snohomish County; it was repeated because it all linked back to the same object
* Short extension of bike path in Shoreline reflecting newly completed construction
* Addition of QR code to map, pointing here, to make finding updates easier

Changes with 1.3:

* Welcome to southern Snohomish County! Roughly 2km of it. This brings complete approaches to the Interurban North and North Creek trails, which are important
* Construction warnings with dates! At least the ones I know about, which means Juanita Way. They're widening the bike lanes but that means there _aren't_ bike lanes sometimes.
* New bike lanes on 73rd Ave NE in Kenmore!
* Bike shop icons in Northshore
* Route updates in Bothell and Lake Forest Park
* Misc small stuff

Changes with 1.2.2:

* Added "Very Bumpy" note near Shoreline Interurban Trailhead
* Added start of bike lanes and note "To Interurban Trail North" above that
* Extended fully-separated lane notation one block east after in-person verification in northern Shoreline
* Corrected types of routes (red-dash vs. green-dot) around Lake Forest Park Town Centre
* Extended North Creek Trail a little into Snohomish County to inciate it continues

Changes with 1.2.1:

* Updating Seattle map to reflect moved/closed bike shops, other small changes

Changes with 1.2:

* Addition of heavily-used but non-official routes, marked in green dotted lines
* Extnesion of MEGMAP to the south end of Lake Washington, using all of the City of Seattle map and adding a little bit of King County Regional Trails to complete the loop

Changes with 1.1:

* Re-implementation of entire map in Inkscape, as opposed to Version 1, which used macOS Preview
* Massive cleanup/removal of jpeg artefacts in the KCGIS background maps

Changes with 1.0:

None; initial release.

By Dara Korra'ti ( https://mastodon.murkworks.net/@moira / https://solarbird.net/blog ) using material
from King County GIS, the very outdated and somewhat inaccurate Kirkland Bike Map, satellite
views via Google Maps, my own biking (quite a lot of that, really), and important initial contributions from:

Erik H. on Facebook (Bothell)

https://social.ridetrans.it/@sip (Shoreline)

https://kolektiva.social/@MHowell (Tolt Pipeline Trail)

The Megamap is a stich-together of the Greater Northshore Bike Route Connector Map, the City of
Seattle Bike Map, the 2 Line Connector Eastside Bike Map, and a tiny bit of King County Regional
Trails Map. See those projects for their individual author/accrediation notes:

City of Seattle Bike Map by City of Seattle Department of Transportation -

This isn't really a project in the software sense, but it is an ongoing project in the greater sense,
in that the map WILL be getting updates, and there will be a couple of versions of those updates,
one for official routes and one for unofficial/suggested routes.

So this seemed as good a place to put them as any, since it supports versioning and forks and such.
