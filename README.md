The Greater Northshore Bike Route Connector Map

Connecting the actively maintained Seattle and 2 Line Eastside bike maps by covering
the cities of Shoreline, Lake Forest Park, Kenmore, Bothell, and Woodinville, along with
Juanita, northern Kirkland, north Redmond, some unincorporated King County, and
southwest Snohomish County

And the MEGAMAP

...which combines Greater Northshore, City of Seattle, 2 Line Eastside,
and a small piece of King County Regional Trails into a poster-sized high-detail MEGAMAP.

**Latest Release 1.4 - August 30, 2024** (dropped early on 29 August for reasons)

Changes:

* New data type - Link Light Rail 1 Line stations
* Added several street name labels, particularly around the new 1 Line rail stations, for improved wayfinding
* Cleaned up other street name labels where bike infrastructure overlaid the KCGIS names
* NEW SEATTLE BIKE ROUTE: MLK north from S. Winthrop to two blocks north of I-90. That's right, it's not on their map yet, but it's open and on mine. 
* Upgraded block connection between Bothell Way and NE 181st/Remington in Kenmore to "Sharerow" after improved paint went in
* "Very Bumpy" advisory REMOVED from Shoreline Interurban Trailhead due to repaving, thank you wildjo here on Github
* Re-added trail exit from Shoreline Interurban Trailhead that got lost somehow in a previous map revision (very small)
* Added two more short sections of what will be the "Trail By the Rail" in Shoreline, adjusted exact ending point of the largest section already on the map, thank you https://social.ridetrans.it/@bobco85 on Mastodon

Coming next release:

* Updated/added bike locker locations
* Three missing blocks of bike lane and sharow in Lake Forest Park
* I-405 in blue, which matched the colour used by 2 Line Bike Connector Map, was too easily confused with water and will be changed to an intensity-matched grey
* Very small cosmetic adjustments

Previous releases:

Changes with 1.3.2:

* Extension of bike lanes on NE 170th in Kenmore to Juanita Boulevard (new construction)
* Addition of new bike shop icon (Eastside Ski & Sport) along East Rail Trail
* Bike parking icon placement and other minor adjustments

Changes with 1.3.1:

* Typo fixed in street number in Snohomish County; it was repeated because it all linked back to the same object
* Short extension of bike path in Shoreline reflecting newly completed construction
* Addition of QR code to map, pointing here, to make finding updates easier

Changes with 1.3:

* Welcome to southern Snohomish County! Roughly 2km of it. This brings complete approaches to the Interurban North and North Creek trails, which are important
* Construction warnings with dates! At least the ones I know about, which means Juanita Way. They're widening the bike lanes but that means there _aren't_ bike lanes sometimes.
* New bike lanes on 73rd Ave NE in Kenmore!
* Bike shop icons in Northshore
* Route updates in Bothell and Lake Forest Park
* Misc small stuff

Changes with 1.2.2:

* Added "Very Bumpy" note near Shoreline Interurban Trailhead
* Added start of bike lanes and note "To Interurban Trail North" above that
* Extended fully-separated lane notation one block east after in-person verification in northern Shoreline
* Corrected types of routes (red-dash vs. green-dot) around Lake Forest Park Town Centre
* Extended North Creek Trail a little into Snohomish County to inciate it continues

Changes with 1.2.1:

* Updating Seattle map to reflect moved/closed bike shops, other small changes

Changes with 1.2:

* Addition of heavily-used but non-official routes, marked in green dotted lines
* Extnesion of MEGMAP to the south end of Lake Washington, using all of the City of Seattle map and adding a little bit of King County Regional Trails to complete the loop

Changes with 1.1:

* Re-implementation of entire map in Inkscape, as opposed to Version 1, which used macOS Preview
* Massive cleanup/removal of jpeg artefacts in the KCGIS background maps

Changes with 1.0:

None; initial release.

By Dara Korra'ti ( https://mastodon.murkworks.net/@moira / https://solarbird.net/blog ) using material
from King County GIS, the very outdated and somewhat inaccurate Kirkland Bike Map, satellite
views via Google Maps, my own biking (quite a lot of that, really), and important initial contributions from:

Erik H. on Facebook (Bothell)

The Megamap is a stich-together of the Greater Northshore Bike Route Connector Map, the City of
Seattle Bike Map, the 2 Line Connector Eastside Bike Map, and a tiny bit of King County Regional
Trails Map. See those projects for their individual author/accrediation notes:

This isn't really a project in the software sense, but it is an ongoing project in the greater sense,
in that the map WILL be getting updates, and there will be a couple of versions of those updates,
one for official routes and one for unofficial/suggested routes.

So this seemed as good a place to put them as any, since it supports versioning and forks and such.
