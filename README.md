The Northshore Bike Route Connector Map
Release 1 / May 2024
Connecting the actively maintained Seattle and 2 Line Eastside bike maps

By Dara Korra'ti ( @moira@mastodon.murkworks.net / https://solarbird.net./blog ) using material
from King County GIS, the very outdated and somewhat inaccurate Kirkland Bike Map, satellite
views via Google Maps, and important contributions from:
 
Erik H. on Facebook (Bothell)
@sip@social.ridetrans.it (Shoreline)
@MHowell@kolektiva.social (Tolt Pipeline Trail)

This isn't really a project in the software sense, but it is an ongoing project in the greater sense,
in that the map WILL be getting updates, and there will be a couple of versions of those updates,
one for official routes and one for unofficial/suggested routes.

So this seemed as good a place to put them as any, since it supports versioning and forks and such.
