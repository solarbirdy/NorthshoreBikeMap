The Greater Northshore Bike Route Connector Map

Connecting the actively maintained Seattle and 2 Line Eastside bike maps by covering
the cities of Shoreline, Lake Forest Park, Kenmore, Bothell, and Woodinville, along with
Juanita, northern Kirkland, north Redmond, and nearby unincorporated King County

Latest Release 1.2.1 - Early June 2024

By Dara Korra'ti ( @moira@mastodon.murkworks.net / https://solarbird.net/blog ) using material
from King County GIS, the very outdated and somewhat inaccurate Kirkland Bike Map, satellite
views via Google Maps, and important contributions from:
 
Erik H. on Facebook (Bothell)
@sip@social.ridetrans.it (Shoreline)
@MHowell@kolektiva.social (Tolt Pipeline Trail)

The Megamap is a stich-together of the Greater Northshore Bike Route Connector Map, the City of
Seattle Bike Map, and the 2 Line Connector Eastside Bike Map. See those projects for their
individual author/accrediation notes:

This isn't really a project in the software sense, but it is an ongoing project in the greater sense,
in that the map WILL be getting updates, and there will be a couple of versions of those updates,
one for official routes and one for unofficial/suggested routes.

So this seemed as good a place to put them as any, since it supports versioning and forks and such.
