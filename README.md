The Greater Northshore Bike Route Connector Map [(direct link)](https://github.com/solarbirdy/NorthshoreBikeMap/blob/main/Greater%20Northshore%20Bike%20Connector%20Map.png)

Connecting the actively maintained Seattle and 2 Line Eastside bike maps by covering
the cities of Shoreline, Lake Forest Park, Kenmore, Bothell, and Woodinville, along with
Juanita, northern Kirkland, north Redmond, some unincorporated King County, and
southwest Snohomish County communities of Edmonds, Lynnwood, Mountlake Terrace, Briar, and Maltby. 

And the MEGAMAP [(direct link)](https://github.com/solarbirdy/NorthshoreBikeMap/blob/main/MEGAMAP%20Combined%20Bike%20Map%20(Greater%20Northshore%2C%20Seattle%2C%202%20Line%20Eastside%2C%20NW%20King%20County).jpg)

Combining Greater Northshore, City of Seattle, 2 Line Eastside, and a small piece of
King County Regional Trails into a poster-sized high-detail MEGAMAP.

**Latest Release 1.7 - May 10, 2025**

* **MAJOR EASTSIDE UPGRADE** with the freshly dropped 2 Line Eastide Bike Connector Map. There are several updates, but the biggest are the two light rail stations opening today, 10 May 2025. If you're reading this on the 10th, there are opening day celebrations and you can go join them.
* Notes about infrastructure continuance off-map now appear on both Greater Northshore and MEGAMAP, with the indicators relocating themselves as appropriate.
* Same for the two major directional notices to Alderwood Mall and City of Snohomish, both of which are too far north for this map.
* Addition with reservations of a short section of what are technically bike lanes in Woodinville. I don't like them and marked them as undermarked, because they are, in person.
* Construction on NE 132nd has extended bike lanes! And made the crossing of I-405 more confusing and probably slower! But also probably safer. It's a tradeoff, and it's on the maps now.
* NE 116th in Redmond has extended bike lanes now, but without the complexity adds of 132nd.
* LOTS of behind-the-scenes work adapting to the new 2 Line update. The biggest unresolved question: should I change my key to match theirs? They've changed fully-separate bike path to a very dark green instead of red. I have NOT done that on 1.7. Opinions?

Coming in next release:

* Refinement of intersections with streets on Interurban Trail North in Snohomish County
* Small additions (short bike lane, shorter trails) around Totem Lake
* Small addition (short mixed-use trail, pedestrian first but bikes permitted) in northern Woodinville at 130th/132nd

Previous releases

Changes with 1.6.1 (May 3, 2025):

* Correction of errors on 84th West in Snohomish County, where sharrows had been incorrectly shown as full bike lanes across a couple of blocks where only one side has full bike lanes
* Added bike lane markers for Forbes Creek Drive in Kirkland
* Further cleanup of the trail situation in and around Crestwoods Park, Kirkland
* Added Old Market Street Trail in Juanita
* Added continuation notes showing how far infrastructure continues on the MEGAMAP's northern border

Changes with 1.6 (April 18, 2025):

* Large expansion north to Lynnwood City Centre rail station across all of SW Snohomish County
* Extension of Interurban Trail in Edmonds to 78th Place West.
* Improved street labelling, mostly in SW Snohomish County.

Changes with 1.5 (February 21, 2025):

* By request, we now cover Newcastle and northernmost Renton, providing the first maps coverage of that area we know about - certainly the most detailed. One benefit of doing so is that we can now provide additional clarity to the southern Lake Washington Loop. (MEGAMAP)
* Added bike lane infrastructure in and around 100th Ave W. in Edmonds (Greater Northshore, MEGAMAP) 
* Upgrade of bike lanes along 15th Avenue S. in Seattle, resulting in a change of marking type (MEGAMAP)

Changes with 1.4.6 (28 January 2025):

* Removal of a bike store icon in Roosevelt and 84th
* Addition of a "Difficult" label on Power Line Trail
* Addition of fully-separated bike lane on 11th Ave NE from 47th to Ravenna, and on 12th Ave NE from Ravenna to NE 69th
* Waterfront Trail: Yesler to Union now open
* Eastlake from Fairview to John now has separated bike lanes, with more to come

Changes with 1.4.5 (13 December 2024):

* The full long-term remapping of Montlake Boulevard at SR-520 with the new bike/pedestrian bridge (opening ceremony **14 December**, was supposed to be finished on the 13th but is not but I'm going with it anyway; MEGAMAP only)
* New Safe/Neighbourhood Greenway streets in northern Lake City (already open; Greater Northshore and MEGAMAP)
* Improved bike lanes/partial off-street lanes in Redmond on 152nd Ave NE north of NE 24th St. (already open; MEGAMAP only)

Changes with 1.4.4 (4 November 2024):

* Yet another correction to Seattle's map showing NW 125th between Interurban and Aurora as sharrows, not bike lanes (thank you, [@pruwyben@social.ridetrans.it](https://social.ridetrans.it/@pruwyben))
* Construction warning flag removed with the end of Burke-Gilman repaving in Bothell
* MEGAMAP only: substantial update/rework of the Montlake Boulevard/SR-520 intersection. Not all planned bike facilities are yet open, but some are.

Changes with 1.4.3:

* Updating Juanita Drive construction area with a temporary downgrade to sharrow, recommending detour
* Slope markers on the closest, most obvious detour route (NE 123rd, NE 132nd)
* NEW BIKE UNDERPASS from Montlake to Bill Dawson trail is open, edited Seattle's map to show
* Additional sharrows in Kirkland near Mark Twain Park
* New 6th Ave NW neighbourhood greenway in Fremont, yes I'm updating Seattle's map for them again
* Updating/clarifications around Montlake Boulevard at SR-520; it's in flux but this is close
* Yes half these changes are on Seattle's map and mostly that's why this version got dropped

Changes with 1.4.2:

* Sammamish River closed one month for construction in Bothell. **There is a detour and it is reasonable**, but I have flagged it on the map as it is a major route.
* Some of the new bike parking icons must be smaller than others, but some were *too* small. These have been enlarged.
* A few small cosmetic improvements

Changes with 1.4.1:

* Updated/added bike locker locations
* Three missing blocks of bike lane and sharow in Lake Forest Park
* Two new blocks of bike lane near Shoreline South station
* Most of the shoulder on Woodinville-Duvall Road is not officially bike lane, turns out one section between 156th and 171st is official, so added
* I-405 in blue, which matched the colour used by 2 Line Bike Connector Map, was too easily confused with water so was changed to an intensity-matched grey
* Other small cosmetic adjustments

Changes with 1.4:

* New data type - Link Light Rail 1 Line stations
* Added several street name labels, particularly around the new 1 Line rail stations, for improved wayfinding
* Cleaned up other street name labels where bike infrastructure overlaid the KCGIS names
* NEW SEATTLE BIKE ROUTE: MLK north from S. Winthrop to two blocks north of I-90. That's right, it's not on their map yet, but it's open and on mine. 
* Upgraded block connection between Bothell Way and NE 181st/Remington in Kenmore to "Sharerow" after improved paint went in
* "Very Bumpy" advisory REMOVED from Shoreline Interurban Trailhead due to repaving, thank you wildjo here on Github
* Re-added trail exit from Shoreline Interurban Trailhead that got lost somehow in a previous map revision (very small)
* Added two more short sections of what will be the "Trail By the Rail" in Shoreline, adjusted exact ending point of the largest section already on the map, thank you https://social.ridetrans.it/@bobco85 on Mastodon

Changes with 1.3.2:

* Extension of bike lanes on NE 170th in Kenmore to Juanita Boulevard (new construction)
* Addition of new bike shop icon (Eastside Ski & Sport) along East Rail Trail
* Bike parking icon placement and other minor adjustments

Changes with 1.3.1:

* Typo fixed in street number in Snohomish County; it was repeated because it all linked back to the same object
* Short extension of bike path in Shoreline reflecting newly completed construction
* Addition of QR code to map, pointing here, to make finding updates easier

Changes with 1.3:

* Welcome to southern Snohomish County! Roughly 2km of it. This brings complete approaches to the Interurban North and North Creek trails, which are important
* Construction warnings with dates! At least the ones I know about, which means Juanita Way. They're widening the bike lanes but that means there _aren't_ bike lanes sometimes.
* New bike lanes on 73rd Ave NE in Kenmore!
* Bike shop icons in Northshore
* Route updates in Bothell and Lake Forest Park
* Misc small stuff

Changes with 1.2.2:

* Added "Very Bumpy" note near Shoreline Interurban Trailhead
* Added start of bike lanes and note "To Interurban Trail North" above that
* Extended fully-separated lane notation one block east after in-person verification in northern Shoreline
* Corrected types of routes (red-dash vs. green-dot) around Lake Forest Park Town Centre
* Extended North Creek Trail a little into Snohomish County to inciate it continues

Changes with 1.2.1:

Changes with 1.2:

* Massive cleanup/removal of jpeg artefacts in the KCGIS background maps

Changes with 1.0:

None; initial release.

By Dara Korra'ti ( https://mastodon.murkworks.net/@moira / https://solarbird.net/blog ) using material
from King County GIS, the very outdated and somewhat inaccurate Kirkland Bike Map, satellite
views via Google Maps, my own biking (quite a lot of that, really), and important initial contributions from:

Erik H. on Facebook (Bothell)

https://social.ridetrans.it/@sip (Shoreline)

https://kolektiva.social/@MHowell (Tolt Pipeline Trail)

The Megamap is a stich-together of the Greater Northshore Bike Route Connector Map, the City of
Seattle Bike Map, the 2 Line Connector Eastside Bike Map, and a tiny bit of King County Regional
Trails Map. See those projects for their individual author/accrediation notes:

This isn't really a project in the software sense, but it is an ongoing project in the greater sense,
in that the map WILL be getting updates, and there will be a couple of versions of those updates,
one for official routes and one for unofficial/suggested routes.

So this seemed as good a place to put them as any, since it supports versioning and forks and such.
