## Supported Versions

As this is really just a way to distribute versioned maps as image files
in PNG and JPG format, there isn't really a vulnerability opportunity
that's specifically related to this project, or that could be addressed
by this project - barring, of course, someone hijacking this project
entirely.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In the event that this project is hijacked and I don't know about it,
I am most easly reached on Mastodon, as @moira@mastodon.murkworks.net
which I check many times a day.

I am also on tumblr as solarbird (though less constantly) and will see DMs
there.
